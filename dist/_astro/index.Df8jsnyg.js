<p>The <strong>UTM curfew</strong> (12 AM to 6 AM) meant I had to start my journey at a specific time. I took the <strong>P211 bus</strong> from UTM to Larkin around 9 PM, followed by the <strong>P101</strong> to JB Central. Fortunately, both of these bus rides were <strong>free of charge</strong>.</p>
<p>Before crossing the border, I took care of a couple of essentials: activating an <strong>international data roaming plan</strong> (RM30) and reporting my stay in Singapore via the <strong>MyICA app</strong>, which is linked to my passport.</p>
<p>From JB Central, I walked to the CIQ. After a passport scan, and then another, I proceeded to choose a bus. As my destination was Queen St, I boarded the <strong>CW2</strong>. Being my first time crossing the border without an <strong>EZLink card</strong>, I used my debit card for the bus fare. A quick wave of the card at JB CIQ, and I was on my way.</p>
<p>The ride from JB CIQ to <strong>Woodlands Checkpoint</strong> was approximately 5 minutes. It was not necessary to tap out with the debit card when arriving there. I scanned my passport at Woodlands, then re-boarded the <strong>CW2</strong> (tapping my debit card again). The bus then continued to <strong>Queen St Terminal</strong>. Again, no tap-out was required upon arrival.</p>

<p>I spent my first night in Singapore at a <strong>McDonald’s</strong> near Queen St Terminal, thanks to their <strong>complimentary Wi-Fi</strong>. There, I had an iced latte and configured my virtual machines and other necessary software for the upcoming SinCon workshops.\r

<p>Early of the next morning, I went to the nearest MRT station by Queen St and purchased an <strong>EZLink card</strong>. The cost was <strong>10 SGD</strong> (5 SGD for the card itself and 5 SGD in stored credit).<br>

<p>The following morning, I returned to <strong>Voco Orchard</strong> for the second day of SinCon. After breakfast, I immersed myself in what became my favorite part of the conference: the <strong>Hardware Hacking Kampung</strong>, hosted by the <strong>bi0sctf team</strong>. Their team members were approachable, willing to teach, and I gained significant insights into hardware hacking. It was, in my opinion, the most engaging kampung.\r
<img __ASTRO_IMAGE_="{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;./assets/bi0s.jpg&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;bi0s&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}"></p>
<p>I also participated in their <strong>hardware CTF</strong> and was pleased to win a <strong>CompatrIoT board</strong>. Look how sophisticated it is.\r
<img __ASTRO_IMAGE_="{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;./assets/compatriot.jpg&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;compatriot&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}"></p>

</ul>
<p>After the hardware CTF, I visited the <strong>RFID Kampung</strong>. There, I received an introduction to <strong>BadUSB</strong> (casually referred to as “bad mouse”) and other RFID-related topics.\r
<img __ASTRO_IMAGE_="{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;./assets/rfid.jpg&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;rfid&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}"></p>

<p>I also stopped by the <strong>Cyber Range Village</strong>, which featured <strong>pentest-style Active Directory CTFs</strong>.\r

I joined their community at <code>rangevillage.org</code> and discovered additional CTFs on <code>playtrv.async.sg</code>. Unfortunately, due to time constraints, I was unable to attend their AD workshop, but it is an area I intend to explore further.</p>
<p>And with that, <strong>SinCon 2025 concluded</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="aftercon-exploring-singapore">AfterCon: Exploring Singapore<a class="anchor" href="#aftercon-exploring-singapore">#</a></h2>
<p>With the conference finished, I took some time for sightseeing. I headed to <strong>Marina Bay</strong> and saw the <strong>Marina Bay Sands</strong>. I also had a view of the <strong>Merlion statue</strong> across the water. My visit included <strong>Gardens by the Bay</strong>, where I saw the iconic <strong>Supertree Grove</strong>.\r

<p>It was then time to begin my journey back. I took the <strong>CW2 bus</strong> from Queen St Terminal. This time, scanning my EZLink card produced a <strong>yellow ticket</strong>.\r
<img __ASTRO_IMAGE_="{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;./assets/cw2.jpg&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;cw2&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}"></p>
<p>The return journey mirrored my arrival: <strong>Woodlands Checkpoint</strong> (passport scan), re-boarded <strong>CW2</strong>, reached <strong>JB CIQ</strong> (another passport scan), then another <strong>CW2</strong> ride to Larkin. From Larkin, the free <strong>P211 bus</strong> transported me back to UTM, concluding my trip safely.</p>

<p>Beyond the formal workshops and talks, SinCon provided an excellent opportunity to connect with fellow <strong>cybersecurity enthusiasts</strong> and join new communities.

After breakfast, I immersed myself in what became my favorite part of the conference: the **Hardware Hacking Kampung**, hosted by the **bi0sctf team**. Their team members were approachable, willing to teach, and I gained significant insights into hardware hacking. It was, in my opinion, the most engaging kampung.\r

\r
I also participated in their **hardware CTF** and was pleased to win a **CompatrIoT board**. Look how sophisticated it is.\r

\r
After the hardware CTF, I visited the **RFID Kampung**. There, I received an introduction to **BadUSB** (casually referred to as "bad mouse") and other RFID-related topics.\r

\r
I also stopped by the **Cyber Range Village**, which featured **pentest-style Active Directory CTFs**. \r

I joined their community at \`rangevillage.org\` and discovered additional CTFs on \`playtrv.async.sg\`. Unfortunately, due to time constraints, I was unable to attend their AD workshop, but it is an area I intend to explore further.\r
\r
And with that, **SinCon 2025 concluded**.\r
\r
## AfterCon: Exploring Singapore\r
\r
With the conference finished, I took some time for sightseeing. I headed to **Marina Bay** and saw the **Marina Bay Sands**. I also had a view of the **Merlion statue** across the water. My visit included **Gardens by the Bay**, where I saw the iconic **Supertree Grove**.\r

\r
It was then time to begin my journey back. I took the **CW2 bus** from Queen St Terminal. This time, scanning my EZLink card produced a **yellow ticket**.\r

\r
The return journey mirrored my arrival: **Woodlands Checkpoint** (passport scan), re-boarded **CW2**, reached **JB CIQ** (another passport scan), then another **CW2** ride to Larkin. From Larkin, the free **P211 bus** transported me back to UTM, concluding my trip safely.\r
\r
## Overall Experience and Reflections\r
\r
Beyond the formal workshops and talks, SinCon provided an excellent opportunity to connect with fellow **cybersecurity enthusiasts** and join new communities. It was a highly positive experience overall, with the **hardware hacking session** led by the **bi0sctf team** being a particular highlight.\r
\r
## Acknowledgements\r
\r
I extend my sincere gratitude to **InfoSec in the City** for selecting me for the **SinCon 2025 student scholarship**. I also offer massive thanks to the **bi0sctf team** for their hardware hacking session, all the **speakers** for their insightful workshops, the **event crews** for their hard work in ensuring the event ran smoothly, and **everyone I had the pleasure of meeting**. I learned a great deal from these interactions.\r
