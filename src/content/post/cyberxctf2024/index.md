## Apocalypse

![](./img/question.png)  
### Description
Notorious hacker CyberSteal6969 has struck again, this time targeting CyberX, stealing a highly confidential flag. Our team managed to seize his personal computer, but the system was wiped clean, except for a single, suspicious image left behind.

Reports suggest CyberSteal6969 may have been communicating with his counterpart using morse code from video. But leave no stone unturned. Can you uncover the secrets within and retrieve the stolen flag?

---
#### Goals
1. Use pngchecker to check the status of the given image, obtained ERROR:"additional data after IEND chunk", which is after the cropped image
2. Use Acropalypse-Multi-Tool to recover the full image
   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R866SnJoKQg
3. Login to flickr with the credentials given
4. Try to find some useful informations across profile
5. Grab the pictures and analyse the metadata
6. Use wayback machine to track past version across the sites

#### Steps
1. pngchecker analyse the image  
   ![](./img/pngchecker.png)  
2. Use the script to recover the full image

3. Retrieve the recovered full image from the specified output directory: /tmp folder
![](./files/restored.png)  
4. Login to flickr with the credentials obtained from the recovered image  
```
cybersteal6969@gmail.com
sh8UPt-S"Cp-6i+
```
 ![](./img/login.png)  
5. Browse through cybersteal6969's profile, we found two videos, flag1 and flag2  
![](./img/cyberstealprofiile.png)  
6. From the video, we analyse the morse code, given "NO FLAG FOR YOU TRY SOMETHING ELSE"
Morse Code Analyser: https://morsecode.world/international/decoder/audio-decoder-adaptive.html
7. From the videos, we know that, it was posted by info stealer6969, shared to cybersteal6969, two of them are communicating  
   ![](./img/infostealerposted.png)  
8. Enter info stealer6969 profile, we found another video, named flag, analyse the morse code, we get "GOODJOBG3TT1NGH3R3", this is the first decoy flag  
![](./img/infostealervid.png)  
9. Keep browsing, we found that info stealer6969 uploaded bunch of pictures  
![](./img/infopic.png)  
10. These pictures containing secret info in their metadata
11. Using exiftool, we found that cat.jpg directs us to https://cyberxstupid.blogspot.com/2024/12/blog-post.html, shown at comment section  
![](./files/pictures/cat.jpg)  
![](./img/exifcat.png)  
12. Randomly clicking through the site, we found the second decoy flag CyberX{c4t_m0us3_g4m3_34sy}  
![](./img/first.png)  
13. Here we need to use Wayback Mahcine, archive.org, to track the past version of the site.  
![](./img/wayback.png)  
14. Under the same link but in past version, we obtain the final flag CyberX{c4t_m0us3_pl4y_m4d3_34s13r}
